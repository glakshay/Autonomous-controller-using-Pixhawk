There a situation for X-plane "cessna.sit" that can be used to start the example.Just add it to the folder "X-Plane 10\Output\situations" and open the situation on X-plane.
In the example there's a inner loop of rol that is described on the paper "paper_control".



If you are using the helicopter library, it's advisable to press the "Free X-Plane" button on the interceface after using the block. X-planes freezes the controls for the collectives, and it's necessary to free it.
